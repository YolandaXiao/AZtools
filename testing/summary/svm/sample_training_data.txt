Motivation: Plant phenomics, the collection of large-scale plant phenotype data, is growing exponentially.
The resources have become essential component of modern plant science.
Such complex datasets are critical for understanding the mechanisms governing energy intake and storage in plants, and this is essential for improving crop productivity.
However, a major issue facing these efforts is the determination of the quality of phenotypic data.
Automated methods are needed to identify and characterize alterations caused by system errors, all of which are difficult to remove in the data collection step and distinguish them from more interesting cases of altered biological responses.
Results: As a step towards solving this problem, we have developed a coarse-to-refined model called dynamic filter to identify abnormalities in plant photosynthesis phenotype data by comparing light responses of photosynthesis using a simplified kinetic model of photosynthesis.
Dynamic filter employs an expectation-maximization process to adjust the kinetic model in coarse and refined regions to identify both abnormalities and biological outliers.
The experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively identify most of the abnormalities in both real and synthetic datasets.

Pathway Commons (http://www.pathwaycommons .org) is a collection of publicly available pathway data from multiple organisms.
Pathway Commons provides a web-based interface that enables biologists to browse and search a comprehensive collection of pathways from multiple sources represented in a common language, a download site that provides integrated bulk sets of pathway information in standard or convenient formats and a web service that software developers can use to conveniently query and access all data.
Database providers can share their pathway data via a common repository.
Pathways include biochemical reactions, complex assembly, transport and catalysis events and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules and complexes.
Pathway Commons aims to collect and integrate all public pathway data available in standard formats.
Pathway Commons currently contains data from nine databases with over 1400 pathways and 687 000 interactions and will be continually expanded and updated.
