In this work, we used DeepDive to extract both protein-protein and transcription factor interactions from over 100 000 full-text PLOS articles. Methods: We built an extractor for gene-gene interactions that identified candidate gene-gene relations within an input sentence. We evaluated this system against the Database of Interacting Proteins and against randomly curated extractions.
